# **Polynomial-Project**

### **DESCRIPTION:**
This project demonstrates Object Oriented Programming in java.  
**Polynomial:** This program stores the Class Polynomial. It has three data members that represent a polynomial and several different methods. Some of which include a method to solve quadratic equations, a method to find the discriminant, a toString method, a method to find the derivative of the polynomial etc.  
**MainApp:** This program acts as a driver for the Polynomial program. MainApp gives the user a nicely formatted menu with different options that represent actions on polynomials. All options give back appropriate feedback to the user.
